# For this design studio portfolio website I created one CSS file and eight HTML files(pages)—four main pages（Home/About/Works/Contact）and four subpages for Works(Graphic design/Website design/ Photography/Project). All project names are linked to the “project” page as this would be a template for all projects.

# I used Grid to arrange all project images and Flex for texts and images combination. For the burger menu, I used some basic JavaScript. I also applied some animation effect on images when hover and hover off. Media query break points are 768px(tablet) and 1200px(desktop).


I spent much time organizing the common style as I wanted to code as less as possible.
But I still missed something, so I had to go back to make adjustments. Also, I found using only one CSS file is a problem as I needed to use too many class names. I think next time I should separate the common style and specific style into different files. Last but not least, I started doing this assignment very early. But other assignments kept coming in, and I needed to suspend the code. Every time I tried to pick up where I left off, I need to reorganize my thinking. This is a little annoying although this is a small website with a few pages. I think the best way to solve this problem is “practise makes perfect”.

By the way, I think Sass is awesome and very efficient, but I can’t handle it very well now, so I didn’t use it in this assignment. But I know if I want to be a better coder, I need to master sass.

In terms of the assets, some images are from my past works, for others(including icons) I downloaded from:

Thanks for teaching us and reviewing my assignment.
Have a nice day and stay safe!
